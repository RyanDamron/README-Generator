# README Generator [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
## Description
This is an app that allows users to automatically generate a README file for the apps they create. I created this app to give people a simple, fun tool to create their README files quickly. README files will look neat and professioinal and will include license badges. This app was fun to make, and helped me learn my nodejs skills.
## Installation
To install this app, clone this repository from GitHub. Once you've cloned it, open it in the integrated terminal and type the command "node index.js". You will be prompted several questions, and when you have answered them, your README file will be created! Make sure to answer questions thoroughly since your README will be public.
## Usage
This app is open-source and free to all.
